    <h2>What is obstetric fistula?</h2>
   <p>Obstetric fistula is a childbirth injury that destroys a woman’s life. <br>It leaves her incontinent, humiliated and too often shunned by her community. Surgery is the only cure.</p>
   </div>
   <h2>How does obstetric fistula occurs</h2>
   <h3>An obstetric fistula occurs when a mother has a prolonged, obstructed labor, but doesn’t have access to emergency medical care, such as a C-delivery.<br> She often labors in excruciating pain for days. Tragically, her baby usually dies.</h3>

   <p class="them">During her prolonged labor, the mother’s contractions continually push the baby’s head against her pelvis. Soft tissues caught between the baby’s head and her pelvic bone become compressed, restricting the normal flow of blood.

  <br><br>Without adequate blood supply, sections of tissue soon die, leaving holes known as “fistulae” between the mother’s vagina and her bladder or rectum. It is these holes that cause incontinence. If untreated, the woman will uncontrollably leak urine, stool, or sometimes both, for the rest of her life.<br><br>For women with obstructed labor, labor that goes unattended, the labor can last up to six or seven days. The pressure of the fetal head on the vaginal wall causes tissue necrosis (tissue death), due to a decrease in blood flow to the area, causing a fistula to develop between the vagina and the bladder or rectum. This is what produces incontinence in a fistula patient.</p>

    <p id="src">The best way to prevent fistula is to ensure that expectant mothers have access to quality health care services before and during childbirth.Fistula treatment goes far beyond repairing the injury. Many patients—especially those who have lived with the condition for years—require emotional, economic and social support to fully recover from their ordeal. We partner with programs such as the NHIF and Campaign to End Fistula.<br><br>Creating a supportive environment for women and girls suffering from Obstetric Fistula through sensitization of communities on the condition will greatly reduce social isolation, thereby reducing incidence of depression. In addition, training of healthcare providers in emergency obstetric care and making available the equipment for deliveries and corrective surgery, transport and communication systems for referrals complete the package of essentials required to end Obstetric Fistula</p> 
   </div>
   <div>
    <p class="d">Another prevention strategy is to provide timely access to safe delivery. Fistula can be prevented through early detection of potential cephalopelvic disproportion and malpresentation and referral of girls and women likely to experience prolonged/obstructed labor to emergency obstetric care facilities.</p>
